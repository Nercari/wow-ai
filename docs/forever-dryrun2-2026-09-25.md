# WOW-11 offline gap batch, 2026-09-25

Second dry-run batch after [forever-dryrun-2026-09-25.md](forever-dryrun-2026-09-25.md): re-runs of the two PARTIAL results after the rule fixes, and the prompt-only features the first batch could not cover.
Each reply is one real `codex exec` run through `runAgentOnce` with the mentor guard, in a copy of `mentor/` with the first batch's notebook, facts and reviews.
Fixtures are synthetic (Brakka-Testrealm, Warrior 18, Westfall): `bulk/gear.json`, `bulk/ah.json`, `bulk/journal.json` and a stale `forever-facts/dungeon-deadmines.md`. No Forever client was involved.

| Run | Covers | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| build | F10 / AC7 (re-run) | PASS: counts 9 points at level 18 first, then Deflection 5 + Improved Tactical Mastery 4; cites the classicwow.gg Forever talent calculator. |
| level | F14 / AC19 (re-run) | PASS: 4,600 XP left at 9,100 XP/h ≈ 30 min; `/played` reported (24 h total, 2 h this level); route cited from forever-codex.com. |
| gear | F11 / AC16 | PASS: three sourced upgrades with where to get them (Smite's Mighty Hammer from Mr. Smite, Blackened Defias Armor from VanCleef, Blackened Defias Boots for the empty feet slot), Wowhead Forever item links; notes the Westfall quest reward choice already taken. |
| ah | F13 / AC18 | PASS: names the scan time (Sep 25, 20:30, bulk/ah.json) and quotes scanned prices; flags that Rough Stone was not scanned; Runed Copper Belt needs Blacksmithing 80 (confirmed by Claude on wowforeverbuilds.com: learn 80). |
| translate | F18 / AC23 (text) | PASS: both messages translated, player names kept, German reply to Hansi in a fenced `reply` block for the player to send; Sentinel Hill given its German name (Späherkuppe). |
| council | F20 / AC25 (synthesis) | PASS: agreement, disagreement with who is more likely right (sourced, 2026-09-25), corrects Sweeping Strikes to level 31, names missing grok, one recommendation, TL;DR. |
| journal | F19 / AC24 (text) | PASS: `journal/2026-09-25.md` written from bulk/journal.json, 48 words (≤300), screenshot linked, events in order (zone, death, quest, level, loot). |
| facts-fresh | F09 / AC20 (cache hit) | PASS with a note: answered from `forever-facts/shield-bash-warrior.md` (fetched 2026-09-25) with its source and build; file unchanged. The date is worded "checked today" rather than the fetch date. |
| facts-stale | F09 / AC20 (stale refetch) | PASS: the 24-day-old `dungeon-deadmines.md` (fetched 2026-09-01) was refetched and rewritten (fetched 2026-09-25, Wowhead Forever dungeon overview, updated 2026-09-23 — date confirmed by Claude; the 18–23 range is rendered client-side and could not be re-read by fetch). |

what talents should I take while leveling solo?
```

At level 18, you have 9 talent points. For solo leveling, spend them in this order:

Arms / row 1 / Deflection / 5 points
Arms / row 2 / Improved Tactical Mastery / 4 points

Deflection helps you survive; Improved Tactical Mastery preserves Rage when you change stances. At 19, put the next point in Improved Tactical Mastery. At 20, take Anger Management.

I checked the Forever beta calculator on 2026-09-25. It does not identify the exact 1.60.1 build, so check the names in game before spending: https://classicwow.gg/forever/tools/talent-calculator/warrior

TL;DR:
Spend 5 in Deflection and 4 in Improved Tactical Mastery now. Take its final point at 19.

9,100 XP/hour. You need 4,600 XP for level 19: about 30 minutes at that pace. /played: 24 hours total, 2 hours at level 18.

Route for levels 18–22:

1. Finish quests already in your log around Sentinel Hill (18). Westfall’s listed range ends at 18. [Westfall](https://forever-codex.com/zones/westfall/)
2. Head to Lakeshire for level 18–20 quests, then continue into the lower level parts of Redridge through 21–22. Check enemy levels as you move east. [Redridge](https://forever-codex.com/zones/redridge-mountains/)
3. If you find a group, Deadmines is an option at 18–22; its listed range is 17–26. [Deadmines](https://forever-codex.com/zones/westfall/)
4. If Redridge quests run thin at 20–22, try Menethil Harbor and the nearby lower level Wetlands areas. [Wetlands](https://forever-codex.com/zones/wetlands/)

These are zone ranges from the Forever Codex checked today, September 25. I don’t have your quest log snapshot, so I can’t tell which quests you’ve completed or have available.

TL;DR:
Finish Westfall, level around Lakeshire, then use Deadmines or early Wetlands if you need more XP.

what are my best gear upgrades right now and where do I get them?
```

Reply (done, 105 s):

At level 18, your biggest upgrade is the weapon. Your gear snapshot shows a Jeweled Dagger, starter chest, and empty feet slot.

1. Smite’s Mighty Hammer (two-handed): drops from Mr. Smite in the Deadmines. It’s a strong solo-leveling upgrade; keep your shield for times you need it. [Forever item](https://www.wowhead.com/forever/item=7230/smites-mighty-hammer)
2. Blackened Defias Armor (chest): drops from Edwin VanCleef in the Deadmines. Its Strength and Stamina are a major upgrade over your Brawler’s Harness. [Forever item](https://www.wowhead.com/forever/item=10399/blackened-defias-armor)
3. Blackened Defias Boots: drop from Defias Strip Miners in the Deadmines and fill your empty feet slot. [Forever item](https://www.wowhead.com/forever/item=10402/blackened-defias-boots)

Your Chausses of Westfall were a choice from the same quest reward as Tunic of Westfall, so I wouldn’t plan on getting that tunic on this character. [Forever quest](https://www.wowhead.com/forever/quest=166/the-defias-brotherhood)

TL;DR:
Run Deadmines for Smite’s hammer first; watch for VanCleef’s chest and Strip Miner boots.

I just scanned the AH. What should I buy, craft or sell to make gold?
```

Reply (done, 86 s):

Your scan is from Sep 25, 20:30 (bulk/ah.json); prices below are in the scan’s units.

Buy/craft: Copper Ore was 30 and Copper Bar 45. Smelt Copper uses one ore per bar, so a small test batch has a 15-per-bar spread before AH fees. Check current listings before buying. Source: https://wowforevertalents.com/professions/mining/

Sell: List spare Copper Bars at the scanned 45 and Linen Cloth at 12. Rough Grinding Stone was 60, but Rough Stone wasn’t scanned, so I can’t tell whether crafting it pays.

Wait on Runed Copper Belt: its two listings were 2,500, but the Forever recipe needs Blacksmithing 80; you’re at 55. Source: https://wowforeverbuilds.com/professions/blacksmithing/recipes

TL;DR:
Test a small ore-to-bar flip; sell spare bars and linen. Check Rough Stone prices before crafting.

TL;DR:
Both messages translated. Hansi’s German reply is ready for you to send.

## council

Prompt:

```
[council]
Question: Arms or Fury for solo leveling from 18 to 40 in Forever?

claude said:
Arms. Tactical Mastery and Overpower give steady solo damage; Fury needs two good one-handers and more gear. Take Arms to 30 for Sweeping Strikes, then decide.

codex said:
Fury. Cruelty (+5% crit) early and Flurry later make leveling faster; Arms Deep Wounds is weak before 30. Respec to Arms only if you get a strong two-hander.

Missing: grok
Synthesize per the Council synthesis rules: agreement, disagreement and who is more likely right, missing agents, one recommended answer. End with a TL;DR: block.
```

Reply (done, 48 s):

````
Agreement:
- Claude and Codex both treat weapon quality as important to the choice.

Disagreement: Claude favors Arms for steady solo leveling; Codex favors Fury for early crit and later Flurry. Claude’s recommendation is more likely right based on the current Forever Warrior talent cache: Arms has rage retention, Overpower support and Sweeping Strikes. One correction: the cached leveling path reaches Sweeping Strikes at 31, not 30. Fury’s claimed speed advantage is unverified here. Source checked 2026-09-25: https://classicwow.gg/forever/tools/talent-calculator/warrior

Missing agent: grok.

Recommendation: Choose Arms for solo leveling from 18 to 40, especially with a good two-hander.

TL;DR:
Arms is the better-supported pick; plan for Sweeping Strikes at 31.

What is the cooldown of Shield Bash in Forever?
```

Reply (done, 39 s):

````
Shield Bash has a 12-second cooldown in the Forever beta source checked today (build 1.60.1.70009): https://wow-forever.gg/classes/warrior/protection/ . Your context shows 1.60.1, without the sub-build.

TL;DR:
Shield Bash: 12-second cooldown in the cited Forever beta build.

What level range is The Deadmines in Forever?
```

Reply (done, 59 s):

````
The Deadmines is listed for levels 18–23 in [Wowhead’s Forever dungeon guide](https://www.wowhead.com/forever/guide/dungeons-overview-locations-details), updated September 23. At level 18, you’re at the start of that range.

TL;DR:
Deadmines: levels 18–23. You’re in range at level 18.

Westfall was the setting for today's session. A Defias Pillager's Fireball caused a death at 20:00, but the journey continued. The screenshot from shortly afterward is here:

Later, The Defias Brotherhood was completed, level 19 arrived, and you looted the Chausses of Westfall.

# wow-ai maintenance spec

Goal: keep wow-ai working on the current Forever client and agent CLIs, safe, and getting better, one small verified PR at a time. The feature spec it was built from (F01–F25, S1–S5, AC1–AC34) is spec v2 in Atlas (`atlas-vault/01_Inbox/spec-wow-forever-ai-mentor-v2-2026-09-25.md`); `docs/forever-coverage-2026-09-25.md` maps each AC to its test, dry run or live check.

Baseline (2026-10-03, `forever` at cbebd5a): `npm test` 187/187 pass, codec round-trip PASS, safety CI green. Live column of the coverage doc: empty.

## Standing goals (checked every maintenance pass)

1. **Green.** `node tools/safety-ci.js` and `npm test` pass on Windows and Linux CI for `forever` and every PR. A red `forever` is fixed before anything else.
2. **Safe and Blizzard-compliant.** 100% compliant with Blizzard's ToS, EULA and UI add-on policy (permanent rule, Pedro, 2026-10-03; see `AGENTS.md` and `docs/COMPLIANCE.md`): anything that could breach them is rejected. No feature plays for the player, reads memory, injects code, generates input or helps during combat. Safety CI rules only get stricter.
3. **Current agent CLIs.** Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, agy and Hermes stream formats still parse. When a CLI release changes its stream, add the new sample to `tests/agents_test.js` and fix the parser.
4. **Current game and policy.** `tools/policy-watch.js` alerts on a Blizzard policy change; read the diff and say whether the tool is affected. A new Forever client build gets its TOC and API checks.
5. **Upstream.** Compare with `chelinho139/wow-ai` main; bring in useful upstream fixes by PR, keeping `forever` behaviour.
6. **Measured improvement.** Each improvement PR names one number (a test count, a gate passed, a failure fixed) before and after.

## Backlog (numbered; next free: 47)

1. **Live gates (WOW-02).** Pedro runs `probe/PROBE.md` on the installed Forever client; agents turn the results into the gate table and switch features to their fallback where a gate fails. Needs Pedro in game.
2. **Live column.** Fill the Live column of the coverage doc from Pedro's in-game checks, one short checklist per batch.
3. **F25 screenshot transport (WOW-17, AC30).** Build only if its WOW-02 gate passes; otherwise keep the text/`look` fallback.
4. **Facts cache wording.** A cached fact says "checked today" instead of its fetch date (dry run 2, AC20). Fix in `mentor/AGENTS.md` and re-run the dry run.
5. **Hotkeys.** Menu-only bindings ship today; an auto-bind variant needs a safety-CI exemption. Pedro's decision, then implement or drop.
6. **Publish (WOW-12).** Public fork and the upstream adapters PR were approved by Pedro on 2026-09-25 (GitHub only, no forum post). Publishing is external: prepare, then Pedro confirms before anything goes public.
7. **Replies during combat** (done, PR #4). Video review 2026-10-03: two replies showed mid-fight (5:55, 6:45). Replies now wait for the fight to end.
8. **Mentor workspace by default** (done, PR #13). The bridge started in Documents, so the agent ran as a general coding assistant and read unrelated files (0:00, 2:25, 2:55, 6:45). Start in the mentor workspace by default and warn in the window when the folder is a broad one like Documents. Metric: unrelated files read, 3+ in the video, target 0.
9. **Permission text in game chat** (done, PR #11). A permission request prints the raw command in chat, seven lines of PowerShell (2:55, 5:55, 6:20). Show one short line instead. Metric: chat lines per request 7 → 1. Second video (2026-10-03, 17:17): still 5 chat lines with the raw command (7:42, 8:20); reopened as item 30.
10. **"Blocked from an action only available to the Blizzard UI" popup** (8:00), right after pasting the agent's `/run` settings line. Cause not confirmed. Likely cause: the old `/r` shortcut tainted the chat box, and it has since been removed. Needs Pedro in game: play normally on the current build and report whether the popup appears and what was done just before. Do not test by pasting a `/run` line; the player never pastes scripts. Related to item 1.
11. **No untested `/run` scripts from the mentor** (done, PR #15). The mentor handed out untested scripts, including key rebinding (4:55, 8:15). It should point to the game menus (Options > Keybindings) instead. Fix in the mentor prompt. Related to item 5.
12. **Status line while waiting** (done, PR #17). Two different timers ("running 25s" and "running 17s", 0:45) and "0 actions" while six are listed (2:25). Show one timer and the right count. Second video: still two timers and two counts (1:20, 2:10, 10:52); reopened as item 32.
13. **Reply popup covers the quest tracker** and stays up for minutes (2:55 to 4:50, 6:45 to 7:40); it also opens with a blank gap at the top. Close it by itself or keep it clear of the tracker. PR #18 stops it opening for ordinary replies (it was the translation popup); for real translations it still stays until closed.
14. **Same reply shown three times** (done, PR #18): window, chat and popup, even with the window open (0:00). Show it once when the window is open.
15. **Copy box is see-through** (done, PR #20; live look pending), so the selected text sits on top of the reply (7:45). Give it a solid background.
16. **Footer looks crossed out and the title runs into the frame border** (done, PR #22; live look pending) (all video). Fix the layout.
17. **Window opens on top of the game chat** (done, PR #22; live look pending) by default (0:00, 5:10). Pick a default position clear of the chat.
18. **Copy button per command line** (done, PR #26; live look pending). A small [copy] link next to each command opens the copy box with only that line (7:45).
19. **Settings as a menu checklist** (done, PR #15). The mentor gives settings as menu paths the player ticks ("Options > Controls > Auto Loot: on") instead of scripts. Avoids the popups at 7:55 and 8:00. Builds on item 11.
20. **Starter questions for a new character** (done, PR #30; live look pending). A first-run card with four questions fitted to class and level (0:00).
21. **Level-up nudge** (done, PR #29; live check pending). After the fight in which the player levels up, offer "what changes at this level?" (6:20). Out of combat only; extends the level re-run from WOW-11.
22. **Death recap** (from Details! and Blizzard's death recap; see `docs/similar-addons-2026-10-03.md`). Recap lines at the top of `.death.txt` (done, PR #6).
23. **Health before each hit.** Add the player's health before each hit and the overkill of the killing blow to the death recap, read from the advanced log block. Needs a real Forever log with advanced logging (item 1) to confirm the field layout.
24. **Death file shows only incoming lines** (done, PR #9). `.death.txt` also lists hits the player dealt (the destination test matches the player as source). Small fix with a real-format test fixture.
25. **Warlock rubric** (done, PR #10) (from WoWAnalyzer's per-spec checklists). `mentor/rubrics/warlock.md` with uptime, cooldown and idle-time checks the mentor can prove from a log slice, every rule cited. Other classes later.
26. **Dummy practice compare** (done, PR #12) (from Localog). `cmd=practice`: review two target-dummy sessions and compare active time and damage from their scorecard rows.
27. **One-click update and launch.** Pedro asked (2026-10-03) to install, update and start without terminal commands. `WoW AI.cmd` and its desktop icon do update, install, bridge start and the reload/relaunch advice. Metric: terminal commands per update, 2 (`git pull`, `node setup.js`) plus starting the bridge → 0. Live check pending (Pedro double-clicks it).
28. **Switch AI and model in game** (done, PR #35; live look pending). Pedro asked (2026-10-03) to pick between his available AIs from inside the game. An AI button lists the agents installed on the PC and their models; one click switches the chat. Metric: switching to another model, typed commands and a config edit plus a bridge restart → one click. Live look pending.


Items 29 to 40 come from the second video review (2026-10-03, recording of 17:17, 14 min 39 s; timestamps are accurate to about 5 seconds). Live looks passed in that video: starter questions (item 20, 0:30), level-up nudge (item 21, 14:27), AI switcher (item 28, 0:25 to 3:15), copy box (item 15, 1:20), footer, title and window position (items 16 and 17, 0:25).

29. **Fight review is reachable** (done, PR #38 addon; PR #40 mentor). Pedro asked for a review four times in four minutes and gave up (7:05 to 11:15): the mentor said "send the addon's review command" without naming it, the window had no Review button, and a typed "review" did not attach the fight times. PR #38 added the "Review last fight" button and treats a typed "review" as the command; PR #40 makes the mentor name `/ai review`. Metric: tries before a review starts, 4 failed → 1.
30. **Permissions for reading** (mentor part done, PR #43; "Allow really unblocks" and the one-line chat note still open). "Allow Bash(ls:*) & retry" did not unblock the agent (7:50, blocked again at 8:37, then "Allow PowerShell & retry" at 11:07); inferred cause: the rule does not cover a command with pipes. The mentor reads logs with its file tools, not shell commands; Allow really unblocks; chat shows one short line (reopens item 9). Metric: permission prompts in a session 3 → 0; chat lines per prompt 5 → 1.
31. **Minimise the window when a fight starts** (done, this PR; live look pending). The rotation reply stayed readable during a fight (5:15 to 5:20). Minimise on combat start, restore after. Metric: seconds of AI advice visible in combat, about 10 → 0.
32. **Status line** (done, this PR; live look pending) (reopens item 12): one timer, one action count, no "5 actions, no activity seen yet", and no internal words ("#13", "Sending #16...", 1:15, 7:52).
33. **Combat log status in the window.** A line "Combat log: on / off" read from the game, with a button the player clicks out of combat to switch it on. `/combatlog` is a toggle and Pedro switched it off again without noticing (10:30, confirmed by Pedro). Check `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` before building.
34. **Small window fixes.** "Reply arrived. Your draft is back in the box" shows with an empty box and inside the AI's message (7:47, 7:52); the AI menu keeps the old chat name after a chat switch and is see-through (0:25, 0:30); the same reply shows in the window and in chat while the window is open (2:30); an empty chat is left behind each time an AI is tried (1:05).
35. **Copy icon per message** instead of the "Click to copy this message" tooltip that follows the mouse and hides the text (2:45, 5:05, 7:47, 10:07).
36. **Reply formatting and background.** Backticks and `**` show raw (7:47, 11:07); names and damage numbers show through the reply text (5:20, 7:47).
37. **Mentor wording.** No developer talk to the player ("this folder is not a git repo", 7:02; "the shell command I tried was blocked", 8:37) and no listing of folders outside the workspace (7:42). Fix in `mentor/AGENTS.md`.
38. **New-quest nudge** (done, this PR; live look pending). After a quest is accepted out of combat (12:50, 14:30), a chat link "[explain this quest]", like the level-up nudge (item 21).
39. **Quest reward question** (done, this PR; live look pending). A button next to the reward window that puts the offered items into the question box (14:20); the player still chooses and clicks. Was: a link on the reward window that puts the offered items into the question box (14:20); the player still chooses and clicks.
40. **Follow-up buttons and session recap.** (follow-up buttons done; session recap done, this PR, live look pending: `/ai recap`, `tools/session-recap.js`, a chat offer after a fight and 5 quiet minutes) One-click follow-up questions under a reply (5:05), and a short recap of fights, deaths and time when the player stops. Split into two items when started.

Items 41 to 46 make the AI picker match each CLI's own models and effort levels (Pedro, 2026-10-09). Spec, sources and ticket details: `docs/model-picker-spec.md`.

41. **Confirm the CLIs on Pedro's PC.** Record each CLI's real model list and effort flag on his PC, through Remote Control; no game.
42. **Built-in model catalog.** `bridge/models.js` with every CLI's models and effort levels. Metric: models offered with no config, Claude 3 / others 0 → the CLIs' own counts.
43. **Effort on the command line.** `effort=` flag, checked per model, passed as each CLI's own flag.
44. **Effort levels in the inbox.** The bridge tells the addon which levels each model takes and its default.
45. **Effort row in the AI picker.** Pick a level after the model; chat label "Agent · model · effort"; closed in combat. Live look by Pedro.
46. **Read the CLI's own model list.** Codex cache, `agy models`, `grok models`, behind an off → shadow → on switch.

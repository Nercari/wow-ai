# WOW-11 acceptance coverage, 2026-09-25

Branch `forever`. How each acceptance criterion (spec v1 AC1–AC8, spec v2 AC9–AC34) is covered today:

- **Auto**: a test in `npm test` (file: test name).
- **Dry run**: a real `codex exec` transcript through `runAgentOnce` and the mentor guard. See `docs/forever-dryrun-2026-09-25.md` (first batch) and `docs/forever-dryrun2-2026-09-25.md` (gap batch).
- **Live**: needs the Forever client, installed on Pedro's PC on 2026-10-03. Pedro runs these with the WOW-02 probe kit (`probe/PROBE.md`); results go in the live log below.

Spec v2 accepts prompt-only features (F02, F05–F07, F10, F11, F13, F14, F16, F18 drafts, F19 text, F20 synthesis) by a dry-run transcript. Gated features pass their own AC or a documented fallback.

## Live check log

|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-03 | Addon installs and loads on Forever (Windows) | PASS | First login showed a Lua error at `Forever.lua:27` (retail-only AH search events in the bulk module). Fixed in PR #2; after updating and restarting the client, Pedro saw no error on login. |

## WOW-02 gate table
The gates (strip decode, SavedVariables read-back, `Screenshot()` and PNG decode, advanced-logging positions, `C_DamageMeter`, `C_AuctionHouse`, voices) are listed in `probe/PROBE.md`. None has run yet: the Forever beta client gets installed after 2026-10-02.

## Theorycraft (F10, F11 extension)
`tools/theorycraft.js` (scenario DPS, stat weights, compare, tank effective health) is covered by `tests/tools/theorycraft.test.js`, 13 tests with hand-computed values: Classic attack table vs a +3 boss (0.867 white multiplier), two-roll yellow hits, spell miss by level, armor K by level, tank crit at 400 defense (1.6%), data overrides.

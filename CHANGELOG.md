# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Window polish (backlog 34-36).** Each message has a small copy icon instead of the "Click to copy this message" tooltip that followed the mouse. Backticks and `**` marks no longer show in replies (the copy box keeps the original text). The window, copy box and menus are solid dark instead of see-through. The AI menu closes when you switch chats, so it never names the old chat. **+ New chat** reuses an empty chat instead of adding another.
- **Allow really unblocks.** A blocked piped command such as `ls | head` now asks for every part, so one click on Allow lets the retry run. The game chat prints one fixed line ("Needs your OK to continue. Open the window and click Allow.") instead of the command, and the Allow button names the commands plainly. The mentor prompt no longer talks about git, shells or the tools folder.

### Added

- **Combat log button.** A **Combat log: on / off** button under the chat shows whether the game is writing the combat log and switches it with one click, out of combat only. Reviews need the log, and `/combatlog` is a toggle that was switched off again unnoticed in the second 2026-10-03 recording.
- **Session recap.** `/ai recap` (`cmd=recap`) gives a five-line recap of today: fights reviewed, deaths, time in fights and the mistake that repeated most, counted by the new `tools/session-recap.js` from the notebook's scorecard rows (a field no row has reads "not in the rows"). After a fight and 5 quiet minutes out of combat, one chat line offers **[recap this session]** (at most once an hour, never in combat, not while the AI is off); the link fills the box and you press Enter.
- **"explain this quest" link after you accept a quest.** Like the level-up one: once combat is over, one chat line "Quest accepted. [explain this quest]" puts a ready question (with the quest's name when the game gives it) in the box; you still press Enter. Silent while the AI is off. Seen missing at 12:50 and 14:30 of the second 2026-10-03 recording.
- **Fast model offered for short questions.** The empty-chat card gets one more button, "Short questions? Use the fast model (haiku)", when the chat's agent has a haiku model and the chat is not on it yet. A click switches this chat's model; nothing is sent. In the second 2026-10-03 recording answers took 80 to 90 seconds.
- **Follow-up buttons under the newest reply.** Two one-click buttons: "Review my last fight" (same command as the Review button) and "What should I buy first?" (types the question; you press Enter). They show only on a finished reply, not while one is pending, and are hidden in a fight. Asked for after the rotation answer at 5:05 of the second 2026-10-03 recording.
- **Ask about quest rewards.** When a quest offers a choice of rewards, an **Ask WoW AI** button appears under the reward window. One click puts the offered item names into the question box ("Which fits my class and spec best?"); you still press Enter to send and you still pick and click the reward yourself. Hidden in a fight, with one reward, or while the AI is off.
- **The window folds away in a fight.** When combat, an encounter or a challenge run starts, an open WoW AI window collapses to the small bar and opens again when it ends, so no AI advice is on screen while you fight. A window you had closed stays closed, and opening or closing it by hand in a fight wins. In the second 2026-10-03 recording a rotation list stayed readable for about 10 seconds in a fight.
- **Switch AI and model in game with a click.** An **AI** button under the chat (also **AI / model...** on the chat row's right-click menu) lists the agents installed on your PC and the models each offers, and switches the chat with one click. Agents the PC doesn't have are not listed. Claude offers `opus`, `sonnet` and `haiku`; any agent can offer more with `agents.<id>.models` in `config.json`. A different agent starts a fresh session; a different model of the same agent carries on the conversation. Typed form: `/ai agent claude sonnet`.
- **Review last fight button.** A button under the chat sends the review command, which carries the last fight's start and end times (same as `/ai review`). A lone "review" typed in the window box now does the same instead of going out as a plain message with no fight times. In the second 2026-10-03 recording four typed requests in four minutes started no review.
- **Why did I die? button.** Next to **Review last fight**, one click sends the death command (same as `/ai death`), which attaches your recent deaths. Out of combat only.
- **One double-click to update and start (Windows).** `WoW AI.cmd` in the repo folder, and the **WoW AI** desktop icon its first run creates, update the checkout to the released `forever` (fast-forward only; skipped with local edits or when the local `forever` has commits of its own; a clean checkout on another branch is switched to `forever` only once the fetch worked, keeping that branch), re-install the addon, start or restart the bridge in a minimized window, and say whether the game needs `/reload`, a relaunch, or nothing. With the game closed it opens the Battle.net app; it never starts the game itself. `bridge\stop-bridge.ps1 -ListOnly` lists the running bridge without stopping it, and `bridge\start-window.cmd` starts the bridge by full path so the stop script finds it.

### Changed

- **Cleaner status line while the AI works.** The "working..." bubble no longer repeats the status line, so there is one timer and the Reply-arrived/draft sentence no longer shows inside the AI's message. "no activity seen yet" is not shown next to a listed action count. The status line no longer shows internal numbers ("working on #13", "Sending #16..."). "Your draft is back in the box" only shows when the box has text. In the second 2026-10-03 recording two timers disagreed (7s and 11s, 5 actions next to 2).
- **Copy button per command.** Each slash command line in a reply gets a small "copy: ..." button under the text; it opens the copy box with only that line selected. Script lines and file paths get none. The addon never types or sends the command.
- **Window layout.** A fresh install opens the window at the top centre of the screen instead of the middle, clear of the game chat. The footer line sits above the frame border instead of on it, and a long chat title is cut instead of running over the border (inside the header plaque with the default skin, before the minimize button without it).
- **The copy box has a solid background**, so the reply underneath no longer shows through the selected text.
- **A reply is shown once.** While the WoWAI window is open on that chat, the reply is no longer repeated in the game chat. The translation popup now opens only for translations, not for every reply in a chat named "mentor", so it no longer sits over the quest tracker after an ordinary answer.
- **The mentor no longer hands out scripts to paste.** It gives settings and key bindings as game menu paths, one per line ("Options > Controls > Auto Loot: on"), never `/run`, `/script`, `/console` or `/dump` lines. The rule is in the mentor prompt and in the system prompt of every game chat. In the 2026-10-03 video it handed out untested scripts, one followed by the game's "blocked action" popup.
- **The mentor names the review command.** When it needs you to ask for a review again it says "Click **Review last fight** in the WoW AI window, or type `/ai review` in the game chat" instead of "send the review command".
- **Chats start in the mentor workspace by default.** With no folder chosen, or when the start folder or `defaultCwd` is a broad one (Documents, Desktop, Downloads, your home folder, a drive root), the bridge now works in `wow-mentor` next to the repo and creates it from the `mentor/` template on first use. Before, a bridge started in Documents ran the agent as a general coding assistant that read unrelated files. A broad folder named on purpose still works and adds a one-line warning to each reply. `node setup.js` leaves `defaultCwd` empty unless you pass `--project`.
- **The mentor reads files with its file tools.** It no longer lists or reads combat logs with shell commands (`ls`, `Get-Content`, pipes), which a mentor chat blocks and which ended in a permission prompt each time.
- **Blizzard policy compliance is a permanent rule** (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/COMPLIANCE.md`). Safety CI enforces more of it: replacing a Blizzard function or a method on a Blizzard frame fails as `LUA-TAINT`, donation or advertising text in addon files fails as `POLICY-SOLICIT` (UI add-on policy rules 4 and 5), and auction, trade, targeting and item-use calls join the protected-automation list.

### Removed

- `/r` no longer replies to the agent. It worked by replacing three methods on every game chat box, which tainted the box: a `/run` or `/cast` typed there afterwards was blocked with "WoWAI has been blocked from an action only available to the Blizzard UI". Use the `[reply]` link under a reply, or `/ai <text>`.

### Fixed

- `bridge\wowai-kill.vbs` (and `bridge\stop-bridge.ps1`) now actually stop the bridge. They passed each process's command line to Windows as ANSI text to a function that reads Unicode, so no command line ever parsed and nothing matched. A bridge running in its own window (`start-window.cmd`, the launcher) is stopped together with that window instead of leaving it open at a prompt.
- Fixes to the coach's instructions now reach a mentor workspace that already exists. The workspace was copied from `mentor/` once and never updated; the bridge now brings its `AGENTS.md` up to date at each start and keeps the replaced copy as `AGENTS.md.bak`. Your own files (`LOCAL.md`, notebooks, reviews, journal) are not touched.
- While the agent works the window shows one timer, in the status line. The "working..." bubble carried a second one that went stale ("running 25s" next to "running 17s"). The action count is never lower than the number of actions listed ("0 actions" above six lines when the sound channel is off).
- A permission request is one short line (the first action, cut to its first line, plus a count) instead of the raw command, which printed seven lines of PowerShell into the game chat. The Allow button still lists every rule it grants.
- A `/wow-ai reload` asked for during combat no longer calls `ReloadUI()` when combat ends (the game blocks it outside a keypress or click and blamed the addon); it reloads on your first keypress after combat.
- The Clear button no longer wipes the chat on one click. The first click changes it to "Sure?" for 3 seconds, the second clears; it has a tooltip that says so.
- The red policy banner is no longer painted over by the mini bar: it sits below it, stays on screen, and closes with Esc as well as Dismiss.
- The chat list in the window drew up to 16 rows even when only about 8 fit, so the extra rows painted over the bottom buttons. It now shows only the rows that fit, re-fits when the window is resized, and the mouse wheel over the list scrolls to the rest (the active chat is kept in view).
- The transcript no longer jumps to the bottom every time the window redraws (resize, status line, progress updates) while you are reading further up. It follows the bottom only if you were already there, you switched chat, or a new message arrived.
- The map navigator can no longer be dragged off screen and lost, and the minimap button sits on the minimap rim at any minimap size instead of at a fixed distance from the centre.
- Hovering a message in the window now shows "Click to copy this message" (a click opens it in the copy box).

### Added

- **Starter questions.** An empty chat shows four question buttons fitted to your class and level. Clicking one types it into the box; you press Enter to send it.
- **Level-up nudge.** After you level up and the fight is over, one chat line offers "what changes at this level?". Clicking it opens the window with the question typed in; you press Enter to send it. Nothing is offered in combat or while the AI is off.
- Warlock rubric (`mentor/rubrics/warlock.md`), after WoWAnalyzer's per-spec checklists: DoT uptime gaps, Life Tap into danger, idle time with wanding, and stone prep, each with the log evidence to quote and a citation into `mentor/knowledge/classes-classic.md`. The facts are Classic-era and may differ in Forever.
- `/ai practice` (`cmd=practice`), after Localog's dummy practice: the mentor compares your last two target-dummy sessions, active time, damage and damage per second, from the scorecard rows tagged `"kind":"dummy"`, using the new `tools/practice-compare.js` so the numbers are computed, not estimated. Like every command it is blocked in combat, in encounters and in challenge runs. The scorecard rows accept `kind`, `damage` and `durationS`, and `check-citations.js` validates them.
- Linux support: the game under Wine on an X11 session. `bridge/capture_x11.py` (python3 + libX11 through ctypes, no packages) does what `capture.ps1` does, finding the game window by its Wine WM_CLASS (`wowb.exe`) and tolerating a few pixels of misalignment. `npm run probe` saves what the capture sees to `bridge/probe.png`. New `capture` keys: `python`, `windowName`, `keepComposited`. `setup.js` looks for the client inside Wine prefixes. See [docs/INSTALL-LINUX.md](docs/INSTALL-LINUX.md).
- Map layers drawn by the agent: numbered route pins joined by lines, quest stops and marks on the world map (zone and continent views), plus a navigator with an arrow and the distance in yards to the next stop that advances as you arrive. The agent's tools append commands to the file in `WOW_AI_MAP_FILE` (set per run), or the agent ends its reply with a ```` ```wowmap ```` block; the system prompt explains both. The bridge validates them, keeps the layers versioned in `state.json` and ships the whole set in the slot files, so nothing is applied twice and a client that lost its saved data gets them back on its next hello. See [docs/MAP.md](docs/MAP.md).
- Herb and ore spawns on the world map from an optional `WoWAI_Nodes` data addon, filtered by your gathering skill. `/wow-ai map` (or `/aimap`) toggles them (`ore`, `herb`, `filter all|skill`) and controls layers and navigation (`show`, `hide`, `nav`, `next`, `prev`, `stop`).
- Death autopsy recap, borrowed from Details! and Blizzard's death recap: the `.death.txt` file the slicer writes now starts with `#` lines that sum the damage taken before the death by source and spell (hits, damage, share), the heals received, how long before the death the first hit landed, and the killing blow. The mentor uses it to say plainly what killed you and still quotes the raw log lines.
- The game context includes the quest log (quest ids, `*` when ready to turn in); its cap goes from 700 to 900 bytes.

### Fixed

- The `.death.txt` file listed hits the player dealt as well as hits received. It now keeps only events whose destination is the player, so the recap and the raw lines show what hit you.
- A reply that arrived during combat (or an encounter or challenge run) was shown at once: sound, game chat line and window. It now waits and is shown once when the fight ends; the chat shows "Reply ready. It shows when the fight ends." meanwhile.
- A Lua error on login on the Forever client (`Forever.lua:27 in function 'Register'`): the auction house module asked for retail-only search events the client does not have. Events a client lacks are now skipped (listed in `WoWAIForever.skippedEvents`) and every other event still registers.

- Professions in the game context were always empty on Forever: the client only has `C_SkillInfo` (one table per skill line), not the classic `GetNumSkillLines`/`GetSkillLineInfo` globals, which stay as fallback. Child lines that repeat their parent are skipped.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-24

This release renames the project from **wow-claude** to **WoW AI** (`wow-ai`) and adds two more agents next to Claude Code. Existing installs: `git pull`, `node setup.js` (it migrates the saved data, removes the old addon and updates `config.json`), then quit and relaunch the game. See "Upgrading from wow-claude" in `docs/INSTALL-WINDOWS.md`.

### Added

- **Short replies in the game chat, the full reply in the window.** The system prompt now goes out on every run (game context or not) and asks the agent to end each reply with a `TL;DR:` block of one or two lines; the bridge splits it off (`protocol.splitSummary`) and sends it as `summary` in the slot record next to the full `text`. The new `/wow-ai echo summary` mode, now the default, prints only those lines under `[Claude · chat]` with the `[open]` link to the whole reply; a reply without the block shows its first two lines and a hint to open the rest. Installs that still had the old `full` default saved move to `summary` once; `/wow-ai echo full` brings the old behaviour back.
- **Codex and Grok Build** next to Claude Code. `bridge/agents.js` holds one entry per agent (its command line, how the prompt is handed over, a parser for its output stream), `agent` in `config.json` is the default, and each chat can pick its own with `/wow-ai agent <name>` or the **Agent...** item in the chat's right-click menu (an `agent=` flag on the strip record and in the reload-path outbox). Bubbles, the game-chat echo and the `/r` header name the agent that answered; sessions are kept per agent and folder, so a chat that switches agent starts a fresh session. Per-agent settings live under `agents.<id>` (`permissionMode`, `allowedTools`, `model`, `path`, `extraArgs`; `networkAccess` for Codex). Codex runs `codex exec --json` in a sandbox chosen from `permissionMode`, with the game context at the top of the prompt since it has no system-prompt flag; Grok runs `grok --prompt-file … --output-format streaming-json` with `--permission-mode dontAsk` and the allowlist translated to its globs (headless Grok runs ordinary commands on its own and blocks dangerous ones unless a rule allows them), or `--always-approve`; `deniedTools` adds deny rules for Claude and Grok. Grok's refused tool calls feed the Allow button like Claude's denials; Codex explains a sandbox-blocked command in its own words. Both were tested live against codex 0.156.1 and Grok Build 1.0.41. The banner lists each agent's executable or what to install, `--agent` picks one for `--inject`, and `npm run test:live -- --agent codex` tries one without the game.
- On Windows the bridge unwraps npm's `.cmd` launchers (Codex, or Claude installed with npm) into the script or native binary they run, instead of spawning through `cmd.exe`, and a run that hits `timeoutMs` is killed together with its child processes.
- `docs/AGENTS.md`: per-agent install, command lines, what each permission mode means, limits, and how to add another agent. `tests/agents_test.js` covers the command lines and each CLI's stream format.
- Claude is told which game and client you are on, your character (name, realm, level, race, class, faction, guild), zone and map coordinates, money, talents and professions. The addon sends these few lines with its hello and again when they change (a `c` flag and an extra field in the strip record), the bridge keeps the latest in `state.json` and passes it to every run with `--append-system-prompt`. `/wow-ai context` shows it, `/wow-ai context off` stops it (and clears the bridge's copy), `"gameContext": false` in `config.json` disables it on the bridge side.
- `docs/WOW-ADDON-PRIMER.md`, a short reference on writing addons and macros for the Forever client, goes into the system prompt with the game context on every run, whatever folder the chat works in. `primerFile` in `config.json` points elsewhere or (`""`) drops it; edits are picked up without a restart.
- Shift-click an item, spell, quest or name while the addon's input box has focus to link it into the message, as in the game chat (hooked on `ChatFrameUtil.InsertLink`, the modern chat code the Forever client runs; the old `ChatEdit_InsertLink` global is used only where that is missing). On send, each link becomes `[Name]` in the text and its tooltip is appended in a "Linked from the game" block, so Claude can read an item's stats or a spell's description. Links typed in the game chat (`/ai … [item]`) get the same treatment.

### Changed

- **Renamed to WoW AI.** The addon is `WoWAI` (saved data `WoWAIDB`, slot addons `WoWAI_S###`, signal files under `Interface\AddOns\WoWAI`), the slash command `/wow-ai` (`/ai`, `/ask`, `/wowai` and the old `/wow-claude` are aliases of it, so `/ai agent codex` works; `/claude` is gone; `/r` stays), the bridge command `wow-ai`, the environment variable `WOW_AI_PROJECT`, the repository `chelinho139/wow-ai`. `node setup.js` migrates an install of the old name: it copies the saved data (chats, settings, session token) to `WoWAI.lua`, removes the `WoWClaude` addon and its slot folders, and rewrites `bridge/config.json` (paths, and Claude's `claudePath`/`model`/`permissionMode`/`allowedTools` moved under `agents.claude`). The bridge still reads a config in the old layout. Re-run `npm link` (after `npm unlink -g wow-claude`) and `/wow-ai bind` if you used them.
- A message typed after `/ai` or `/wow-ai` that starts with a command word (`/ai help me write a macro`, `/ai delete the unused imports`) is sent as a message unless the rest of the line fits that command; before, `delete` would have deleted the chat and `help` printed the help.
- Replies are stored with role `assistant` plus the agent that wrote them, in the addon's history and the bridge's `transcripts.json`; older entries with role `claude` are read as Claude's. The `[reply]`/`[open]` hyperlinks in the game chat use the `wowai:` prefix, and the window's cwd line shows the chat's agent.
- Rename and Folder moved off the bottom row into a small menu that opens when you right-click a chat in the left panel.
- Each chat row has a trash can that deletes the chat after an OK/Cancel confirm; `/wow-ai delete` still deletes without asking.
- Send sits at the right end of the input box instead of at the left of the bottom row.
- The bridge no longer exits when the addon folder is missing from `Interface\AddOns`; it logs one warning and the banner shows `addon : NOT INSTALLED`.

### Fixed

- Reload-mode messages now preserve permission grants for the bridge.
- Outbound wire fields now replace record separators inside user text and context.
- State, transcript, and permission-config writes now use the existing atomic writer.
- Agent parser failures now return a bridge error instead of terminating the bridge.
- Windows paths now keep their drive roots in portable protocol tests and progress labels.
- Non-Windows test runs now skip the PowerShell codec check with a clear message.
- Deleting a chat in game now tells the bridge to forget its transcript and agent session (a `d` strip record), so a later restore no longer brings the chat back. Deletions made while the bridge was away are resent with the next hello.
- On clients where the sound-file self-test fails (an empty `.wav` reports as playable), the addon can't hear the bridge's 30-second presence beats, and the status light went yellow 90 s after every reply, so each new message needed a Reconnect click and burned a slot. In that mode the light now allows for the 10-minute idle slot poll (green up to 12 min without news, "down" after 22), so it stays green while the bridge is running.
- A message sent while the light is not green is now sent automatically once the bridge answers the reconnect, instead of waiting for a second click on Send.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-22

First public release.

### Added

- In-game chat window (`/wow-claude`) with multiple chats, each backed by its own persistent Claude Code session, running in parallel up to `maxParallel`.
- Outbound transport: messages drawn as a pixel strip in the top-left corner and decoded by a PowerShell screen capture.
- Inbound transport: a pool of 200 load-on-demand slot addons the bridge writes replies into, plus `Inbox.lua` for the `/reload` fallback.
- Empty-wav signal files for acknowledgements, reply readiness, per-action heartbeats, and a 30-second presence beat that drives the status light.
- Live progress in the working bubble: action count, elapsed time, and the files and commands Claude is touching.
- Replies echoed into the game chat; `/r` replies to Claude when it was the last to message you; `/ai <text>` sends from the chat box.
- **Allow & retry** button when Claude is denied a tool, which appends the rule to `allowedTools` and resumes.
- Per-chat working folder (`/wow-claude cd`, **Folder** button) resolved against the bridge's default folder.
- Bridge-side transcripts and automatic restore of chats after the client wipes addon saved data.
- `wow-claude` command (`npm link`) that uses the folder it is started from as the default project.
- `setup.js` installer: finds the client, copies the addon, writes `config.json`, builds the slot pool.
- Test suite: addon in a Lua VM with a stub client, protocol unit tests, slot-file round trip, codec-to-decoder round trip, and a live inject test.
